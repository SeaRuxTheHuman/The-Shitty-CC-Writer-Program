# The-Shitty-CC-Writer-Program
### Shitty ComputerCraft Writing At Its Finest!

---
Welcome to my the gihub page for my horibly coded, bug riddled & just generally crappy writing program that i made because I was bored. 

It was only ever meant for testing purpouses (to make an actually good writing program) but I made it a full program out of it because _**why not**_. To be honest if I actually did this properly instead of the way I
did, I'm confident that it would have turned out.. less shit?

Anyway enjoy! my very buggy and yet kinda nifty little page writing program.
